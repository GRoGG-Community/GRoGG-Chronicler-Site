# Setup

run `npm install`

run `npm start` to run both the json server and react devserver

## json-server
This project uses [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) as a mock api-server on port 3001. The data is stored in the [db.json](client/db.json).

Check the [api docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server#routes) for information on the full available api.

The server is available at `localhost:3001` as well as `localhost:3000/api`
